<p>Dear {{client-name}}, </p>

<p>{{add-msg}}</p>

<p>We need you to provide appropriate documentation to verify your identity. </p>

<p>To make this process simple and secure, we use 'Yoti' for online verification (option 1 below). More information can be found on the Yoti website here (www.Yoti.com). Alternatively, you may follow a manual process & provide us with certified copies of
    your identification documents, however please be aware this will take longer to complete. </p>


<u><b>Option 1: Digital ID Verification (YOTI) </b></u>

<p>Yoti are ISO/IEC 27001 certified and operate a rigorous approach to security.</p>

<p>To complete your ID verification, please click on the link below and follow the instructions provided. Note you will need a form of photographic ID (e.g. driving license), to complete the process.</p>

<br>
<br>
<u><b>Option 2: Manual ID Verification</b></u>

<p>Please provide either your current photo card driving licence, or one document listed in column A <u><b>AND</b></u> one document listed in column B: </p>

<table style="width:60%;">
    <tr style="text-align: center; font-weight: 400;">
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: #f5f5f5;">
        <td>Current signed passport</td>
        <td>Utility bill (not mobile phone) or bank statement</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>National ID card</td>
        <td>Local tax authority correspondence sent to your home address</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: #f5f5f5;">
        <td>Residence permit (with photograph)</td>
        <td>Local authority bill, e.g. council tax</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>Entry in a local or national telephone directory confirming your name and address</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Please note that the documents listed in column B above should be less than three months old when provided to us.</p>

<p>The documents that you provide will need to be certified; this is explained in more detail immediately below.</p>

<u>Certification of documents</u>

<p>If you wish to send us copies of your identification documents, can you please arrange for them to be certified first by a UK solicitor, accountant, doctor or high street bank manager and then for the original certified copies to be posted to us at the
    following address:</p>

<p>If, however, you would prefer to attend our offices with your original documents please do let me know so that we can arrange a time for us to certify them. </p>
